		<p class="zird__text">Its long tunnel-like streets are dotted with buildings of incredible geometric shapes. The
			buildings are divided into sectors by mathematically accurate contours. Skirting them, electromagnetic roads
			stretch into the distance of miles in a form of wide strips. The roads catch up and split up with a monorail
			string stretched along
			the sky.</p>
		<p class="zird__text">There are no trees and green lawns in the parks. You can't hear the chirping of birds and the
			splash of water on smooth granite stone. Instead, the huge cylindrical skeletons spread their flexible crowns,
			flashing the daylight of the ProtoStar through the lattice bodies. On their thin, metal rods, drones buzzing with
			their blades find refuge, pouring clots of waste oil onto the shoulders of gaping passers-by. The hinge fingers
			shake them off awkwardly, hurrying until the pungent ooze has eaten into the metal body.</p>
		<p class="zird__text">All of them are so different and so similar at the same time. Angular, smooth, tall, low, with
			protruding bundles of wires from the carbon skull. Scanning at a glance, wise with their life experience, and very
			young, at the same time, looking at the world with their diode wide-open eyes.</p>
		<p class="zird__text">Their lives were never following the laws of the robotics world. No one assigned tasks to them
			and did not set goals. The only thing that could restart them was a short circuit which gave a rise of a spark
			inside that triggered a mechanical heart. The large, open world itself gave them the opportunity to find the
			script they needed for the circulation of electronic data, enlivening the selected cell to reach the goal.</p>

		<p class="zird__text">Every day, Zird inhabitants wake up from hibernation, polish their hulls, sketch out their
			skin and commune at the same table, charging their energy capsules, preparing for the day ahead. Young bots will
			go to their Universums, while their ancestors will give their last energy to their aim at the predetermined age
			point.</p>
		<p class="zird__text">The sounds of the unpretentious Xi-language will intertwine in conversations, orders, timid
			requests and complaints. Their complaints are about a robot who again knocked a holograph and a favorite ebook off
			the shelf. They do not know why they start such discussions.</p>
		<p class="zird__text">The noise of alfa cars and hyperloops will merge with the overflow of metal pipes of the
			center of "Neuro Karmic purification". Here, under the electric mantras, the overloaded consciousnesses feel free
			after the cache clean-up. This starts from the first rays and continues to the last evening flash that originated
			on the horizon and died at the tip of the Meridian skyscraper. The higher sphere, where the great Andros live, who
			are the conductors of the most complex cyber processes, carrying their will in the form of the supreme language
			dialect- which is called Libra.</p>
